                    <p id="parafix">Our “What’s a River Worth?” feature splashed into Colombia’s Orinoco River, where a small but diverse team was working together to assess the river basin’s health. They used a river basin “report card” to translate complex scientific data into a simple conservation summary everyone could understand. Thanks to a new open-source template developed by WWF and the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, those closest to the river and its resources were able to independently develop the report card. Now, this globally recognized template for a community-developed report card is empowering those who live near, and depend on, river systems around the world.</p>

                    <p id="parafix">There are fewer than 6,500 snow leopards left in the wild. Please make a monthly commitment today to help us conserve the world's wildlife and their homes by symbolically adopting a snow leopard.

                            Monthly gifts provide WWF with the dependable stream of support we so critically need for our global conservation efforts.
                            
                            When you donate at least $8 a month, you can receive a symbolic snow leopard adoption kit as our way of saying thank you. There is still time to make a world of difference—please join us today.

                    <p id="marginfix">POST IN APR 1ST</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p id="parafix">While most loss or waste of food takes place in restaurants, hotels, grocery stores, or our own kitchens, crops that go unharvested on farms are a piece of the puzzle too: It’s estimated that 10–19 million tons of produce never make it past the farm gate each year.

                            On the upside, nearly all of that is composted, fed to farm animals, or tilled back into the ground. But it still means a lot of water, land, and other resources were used to grow food that won’t be eaten by people.
                            
                            Some loss of crops is nearly impossible to avoid. It can happen because of unpredictable weather events, pests, market price changes, labor shortages or costs, rigid cosmetic standards, or simply because we choose to eat only part of certain plants.</p>
